# Tic Tac Toe
Simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe game in Python using MVVM pattern without any library dependencies. The game allows you to choose the size of board and number of marks in a row, column or diagonal necessary for winning.

It was developed as a training in MVVM patter. If you understand MVVM better or just see something you don't like in my code I would be grateful for any comments or criticism.

# Preconditions to run the game
Only thin you should need is to have the Python 3 installed. Game does not use any library dependencies, just make sure that your Python 3 distribution have tkinter.

# Running the game

To run the game execute `main.py` script.
